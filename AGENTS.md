# Agent Guide

This file is the execution card for Tochnyi Charts. The project applies the Universal, Agent Tool, and Artifact Generation portfolio profiles. `README.md` owns workflow orientation, `STATUS.md` owns supported scope, `docs/architecture.md` owns role/layer boundaries, `docs/testing.md` owns infrastructure verification, and the batch/source-ledger/authoring documents own their specialized contracts.

## Start here

1. Read [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and preserve unrelated source sets/run artifacts.
2. Read `STATUS.md`, `README.md`, and only the relevant role section in `docs/architecture.md`.
3. Choose the role before editing: batch orchestration, chart authoring, or infrastructure maintenance.
4. Normal chart production enters through `tool-api/chart.js`; renderer internals are infrastructure-only.
5. Batch changes read `docs/batch-workflow.md` and `docs/source-ledger.md` before changing inventory, selection, staging, or finalization.
6. Infrastructure changes read `docs/testing.md`, the owner implementation, and focused tests.

If architecture, source-ledger contracts, Tool API schemas, recipes, tests, and implementation disagree, repair the owning authority rather than adding workaround instructions.

## Role guardrails

- The exact project-root `input/` set and source ledger own batch evidence/disposition. `ChartSpec` owns semantic chart intent. Renderer code owns coordinates/CSS/library mechanics. Generated HTML/PNG/manifests/QA/PPTX are outputs, not authority.
- Preserve source anchors, explicit structured selectors/derivations, and selected/merged/omitted dispositions. External research may fill documented gaps or add relevant context but must not silently originate an unrelated story.
- Chart authors own evidence fidelity, safe derivation, editorial meaning, workflow/recipe selection, and semantic values. Authoring defects are fixed in source ledger/spec; rendering defects are fixed in infrastructure. Do not hand-edit generated HTML.
- Publication is staged. Failed rebuilds leave the prior valid delivery intact; successful rebuilds remove/regenerate downstream artifacts containing stale images; finalization purges transient work only after source/spec consistency checks.
- Tool API commands remain bounded, semantic, and machine-readable. Reject unsupported fields instead of silently ignoring them; do not leak renderer knobs into `ChartSpec`; orientation commands expose the public workflow without repository-wide exploration.
- Compatibility entrypoints remain only while documented/tested. Keep source orchestration outside renderer internals and renderer policy outside the batch layer.

## Verification

Use the narrowest relevant lane during iteration; the complete automated suite is:

```text
npm run test:all
```

Use diagnostics/samples/visual/quality only for their owned surfaces. Machine tests do not replace source-fidelity/editorial review, and visual review does not replace schema/workflow verification.
